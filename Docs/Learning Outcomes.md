   - Interpret and visualize bibliometric data to enhance research impact.

3. **Critically Evaluate and Synthesize Research Studies**  
   - Assess the quality of selected studies using standard appraisal tools.  
   - Identify key themes, patterns, and trends in existing literature.  
   - Develop structured summaries and conceptual frameworks for literature synthesis.

4. **Apply Text Mining & NLP for Literature Review**  
   - Extract and analyze textual data from academic papers using **Python (NLTK, spaCy) and R**.  
   - Identify thematic clusters and keyword patterns within research fields.  
   - Use NLP techniques for automated literature categorization and gap analysis.

5. **Structure and Present Research Findings Effectively**  
   - Develop well-organized and comprehensive literature review sections for research papers.  
   - Present systematic and bibliometric review findings in academic publications and conferences.  
   - Use visual storytelling techniques to communicate complex bibliometric insights.

   - Analyze trends and emerging areas in the research domain.  
   - Propose novel research questions based on systematic literature evidence.  
   - Position research contributions effectively within the existing body of knowledge.

7. **Enhance Academic Writing and Research Productivity**  
   - Use **reference management tools** like **Mendeley or Zotero** to organize citations.  
   - Ensure adherence to academic integrity and proper citation practices.
