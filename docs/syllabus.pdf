# **Workshop on Systematic and Bibliometric Literature Review**  
## **Syllabus**  
### **Instructor**: Dr. I. K. Nti  
### **Institution**: University of Cincinnati  
### **Duration**: 3 Days  

## **Course Description**  
This workshop provides postgraduate students and early career researchers with the essential skills to conduct systematic and bibliometric literature reviews. 
Participants will learn how to structure and conduct high-quality reviews using systematic review protocols and bibliometric tools such as VOSviewer and R. 
The training is designed to enhance research rigor, identify gaps in the literature, and facilitate the integration of evidence-based findings into research projects.

## **Learning Objectives**  
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:  
1. Develop a systematic review protocol, including research questions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and search strategies.  
2. Use bibliometric tools (VOSviewer and R for bibliometrics) to analyze research trends, key authors, and citation networks.  
3. Critically evaluate and synthesize studies for systematic reviews.  
4. Apply text mining techniques to analyze research literature.  
5. Structure and present a systematic or bibliometric review for academic publications.
